Carbon
======

Carbon is a plugin which adds 1.8 blocks and features into a spigot protocol hacked server.

Download the final plugin here: http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.1258/ , it should be mostly bug-free. If not, post an Issue containing the Version number you are using!

.

Some things to note before downloading and compiling the repository:

- Make sure you always use the latest version and you have all of the dependencies installed locally.
- If any ingame error (not compiling and other, but ingame error) occures make sure to immediately post an Issue!

.

Some things to note before submitting a pull request:

- Make sure you always use Carbon.injector() for retrieving references to new blocks, materials, and items
- Make sure all the code you submit is compliant with Java 6
- Make sure all dependencies added have an appropriate Maven repository in the pom.xml.
- Only submit the source code, pom.xml, and plugin-related resources to the repository.
- Do not submit a pull-request for very minor changes. Ex: Spelling, spacing, etc. You may submit a pull request that changes many files at once for spelling and spacing.
- Please use all proper Java conventions Ex: No capitalized fields unless constant, no capitalized methods, etc...
